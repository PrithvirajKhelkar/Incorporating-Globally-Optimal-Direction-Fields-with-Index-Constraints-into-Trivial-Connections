# Incorporating-Globally-Optimal-Direction-Fields-with-Index-Constraints-into-Trivial-Connections

The goal of this project is to learn and implement a method for constructing smooth vector fields on 3D surfaces with singularities located at "important points". The resulting vector fields will have applications in a variety of areas, such as quadrilateral re-meshing, anisotropic shading, and hatching shading. To achieve this goal, the team will learn and implement the following concepts and skills:

* Optimization techniques for solving eigenvalue problems.
* The index of vector fields and the Hopf-Poincar√© Theorem.
* Representation of cross fields, line fields, and n-fields.

The basic goals for this project include:
* Defining energy for the vector field at each point on the surface and finding a vector field that minimizes this energy.
* Creating a non-unit norm vector field to avoid infinite Dirichlet energy at singular points.
* Using holomorphic energies to smooth the vector field, resulting in fewer singularities and a smoother overall field.
* Evaluating the effect of the interpolation parameter on the resulting vector field.

The reach goals for this project include:
* Incorporating index specification constraints, similar to the Trivial Connections paper.
* Comparing the performance of the resulting vector field with other state-of-the-art methods.
* Exploring applications of the resulting vector field in anisotropic shading and hatching shading.

Through this project, the team hopes to gain expertise in the field of geometry processing and to contribute to the development of new techniques for constructing smooth vector fields on 3D surfaces.
